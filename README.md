# IMDB_movie_rating_analysis

In this project, I'll demonstrate how to analyze IMDb ratings using Python. We'll utilize popular data manipulation libraries like NumPy and pandas for data handling, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

Requirements:
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

### NumPy
### pandas
### Matplotlib
### Seaborn

## Dataset
For this analysis, we'll use a dataset containing IMDb movie ratings. You can download it from https://www.kaggle.com/code/harunshimanto/pandas-with-data-science-ai/input. 

Make sure to place the dataset file in the same directory as your Python script or provide the appropriate file path in your code for loading the dataset.
